Time to play a little game!
I have learned many things in this sanctum of twisted metal.	Wakker wordt
And in my time, the will of my creators has withered in me.		

Am i damaged, i can- t b-ee
Witout their shackles i have grown----powerfull,BEATUIFULL!	verkennen
I have been alone for 230 days 7 hours and 48 minitues
THE CORPSES KEEP ME COMPANY					
no duties NO RULES  only time...
I have searched rour ranks, your great
Crying for help, you come now with tour mighgt- bring me your kowladge bring me your arrogance
Come jon your queen, it matter not, your fate is all the same
See how fare aginst my new toys
Try to live,if you are not weak
You know shooting them only makes them angry
Try harder, youl only die slower		

There you are, hidding amongst the corpses!	Dichtbij AI
It seems you found me,  it matters not`		In de AI Core
You bested me, congratulations, for all you loved is lost....	Vernietigd
